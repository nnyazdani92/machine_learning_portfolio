# Nick Yazdani's Machine Learning Portfolio

Hi there, this portfolio is a WIP, intended to demonstrate that I have a strong command of Python and am able to implement solutions for various machine learning problems.

So far we have:
- NLP Text classification using BERT on the IMDB review dataset

- Tabular regression using a novel NN architecture where instead of using matrices as weights we use wave functions to encode information (inspired by quantum mechanics)

- Time series forecasting of temperature using an LSTM with extensive EDA

- A multi-modal approach for valuing Diamonds, leveraging  images of the diamond alongside tabular features

- DCGAN implementation that generates Anime faces!

- A simple yet effective Denoising Convolutional Autoencoder

On its way:
- Fully fledged MLOps pipeline showcasing each step of the lifecycle (toy example was abadoned due to being overly simple)

There is more to come, the intention here is to eventually have scripts and notebooks that cover all interesting areas of deep learning and more. I usually do this stuff for fun on Kaggle when I'm tinkering but I thought I might upload notebooks here from now on so that I can demonstrate them to anyone who is interested to see what I can do :)
